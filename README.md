My opencv experiences while learning it.

- Simple VideoWrite

  This takes two images of arbitrary people and makes a 4 second video from them.
  Reads images via cv2.imread()
  Scales images via cv2.resize()
  Produces the video via cv2.VideoWrite class

- Simple VideoCapture
  
  Reads "Me Me Big Boy" and plays back to you via cv2.VideoCapture() class.
